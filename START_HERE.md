## 🎯 HACKER NEWS LAUNCH STRATEGY

### Best Timing
- **Day:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Time:** 8:00 AM Pacific Time
- **Why:** Maximum visibility when US devs start their day

### Recommended Title
```
Show HN: FLUX – AI-to-AI protocol with 48% size reduction over JSON
```

### First Comment (Post immediately after submitting)
```
Creator here! Built FLUX for my space-based solar power project's AI 
monitoring system. The key insight: AI agents don't need human-readable 
JSON. 48% bandwidth reduction = 48% lower cloud costs.

Installation: pip install flux-protocol

Happy to answer any questions about the protocol design or use cases!
```

### Response Strategy
1. **First 2 hours:** Respond to EVERY comment
2. **Be technical:** Show benchmarks, code examples
3. **Be humble:** "Still learning, feedback welcome"
4. **Be helpful:** Answer all questions thoroughly
